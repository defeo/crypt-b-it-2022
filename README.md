# Sagemath environment for [crypt@b-it 2022](https://cryptabit.bit.uni-bonn.de/2022)

For the tutorials on isogeny based cryptography we're going to use
[Sagemath](https://www.sagemath.org/).  It's advised to use the most
recent version, 9.6, as it contains substantial improvements in
computing isogenies.


## Install Sagemath

If you have the opportunity, it's recommended to install Sagemath on
your personal machine. Instructions at
<https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html>.

## Use Sagemath in the cloud

One way to use Sagemath in the cloud is to use the
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service. To get started, simply [click
here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/defeo/crypt-b-it-2022/master).

If launching hangs for more than a minute, give it another try by
reloading the page, or clicking on the link again.

Be warned that whatever work you do is not saved in the cloud! Do not
forget to download your work at the end of the session.

## Using Sagemath in yet another cloud

An alternative way to use Sagemath in the cloud is to create an
account on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/).

Your work will be saved in the cloud, so you'll find it there when you
come back.
